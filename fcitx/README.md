# Fcitx

[Fcitx(5)][fcitx] is an input method framework.

## Use Cases

Fcitx can be used to:

- Type Japanese with [mozc][mozc] on both Xorg and Wayland
- Have a working [IME][ime] in the kitty terminal
- Have a working IME for Anki and similar applications

You should not use Fcitx if:

- You don't need to type in another language like Japanese
- You're only using GNOME (ibus + anthy works well there)

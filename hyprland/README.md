# Hyprland

[Hyprland][hyprland] is a new tiling Wayland compositor written in C++.

## Use Cases

Hyprland can be used to:

- Take advantage of Wayland, without having to resort to the i3-like Sway
- Use a Wayland compositor that opens windows in a similar vein to bspwm
- Have dynamic workspaces out of the box, with no configuration necessary.
- Have instantaneous partial scaling support and monitors with different refresh rates
- Have live multi-monitor support without having to deal with xrandr/arandr.
- Have gestures without having to worry about bugs in `libinput-gestures`
- Drag and drop windows across monitors and switch focus between them, unlike bspwm

You should not use hyprland if:

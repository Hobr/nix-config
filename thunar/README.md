# thunar

[thunar][thunar] is a GTK file manager.

## Use Cases

thunar can be used to:

- Have a graphical interface for browsing files on a computer
- Not worry about the cascading effect of nautilus
- Have thumbnails update instantly, no refresh needed most of the time

You should not use thunar if:

- You want to search in your file browser (nautilus is better for this)

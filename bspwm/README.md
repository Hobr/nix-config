## Use Cases

bspwm can be used to:

- Have complete control of your window manager through simple shell commands
- Minimize resource usage; bspwm works best without a desktop environment

You should not use bspwm if:

- You are using a desktop environment
- You just want to open multiple shells (use [kitty](/kitty) or [tmux](/tmux) for this instead)

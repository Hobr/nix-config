# tint2

[tint2][tint2] is a simple panel/taskbar made for modern X window managers.

## Use Cases

tint2 can be used to:

- Have a taskbar that automatically shows individual programs on each desktop, without having to perform polybar shenanigans.

You should not use tint2 if:

- You require functionality that would be easier to implement with other bars.
- You are not using an X window manager.
